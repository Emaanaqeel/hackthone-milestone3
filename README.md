Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder
Objective: Add functionality that allows users to create a resume by filling out a
form.
Action Steps:
● Form Creation: Create a form with fields for all the necessary
information—personal details, education, work experience, skills, etc. Use HTML
to create the structure of the form.

● Form Handling with TypeScript: Use TypeScript to handle the form data. When
the user submits the form, the information should be used to dynamically
generate the resume. This means that the resume content will be updated based
on what the user inputs in the form.

● Validation: Add validation to the form fields to ensure that users enter the
required information correctly. For example, check that the email address is in
the correct format and that the required fields are not left empty.

● GitHub Update and Deployment: Update your GitHub repository with the new
code and redeploy the project on Vercel. This ensures that your dynamic resume
builder is accessible online for others to test.
